Certainly! Here's a Python program to generate the Fibonacci series:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    fib_series = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_series.append(fib_series[i-1] + fib_series[i-2])
    return fib_series

# Change the value of 'n' to generate Fibonacci series up to that number
n = 10
print("Fibonacci series up to", n, ":", fibonacci(n))
```

This program defines a function `fibonacci(n)` that generates the Fibonacci series up to the nth term and then prints it. You can change the value of `n` to generate the series up to any desired term.
